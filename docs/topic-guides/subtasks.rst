Subtasks
========

The concept of **subtasks** was first formally introduced in IOI 2010. The idea is basically to split a problem into two or more smaller problems with gradually increasing difficulty, and assign them different points.

For example:

| **Subtask 1 (20 points)**
| - N = 1
| - 1 ≤ K ≤ 100
|
| **Subtask 2 (20 points)**
| - 1 ≤ N ≤ 100
| - K = 1
|
| **Subtask 3 (60 points)**
| - 1 ≤ N ≤ 100
| - 1 ≤ K ≤ 100
|

In this type type of problem, you won't be writing a ``Constraints()`` method. Instead, you will be writing ``SubtaskX()`` methods, where ``X`` is the subtask number.

.. note::

    As of this version, you can define up to 25 subtasks: **Subtask1()** .. **Subtask25()**.

Subtask definitions
-------------------

A subtask is basically just a set of constraints. It can be specified by the method ``SubtaskX()``, where ``X`` is the subtask number. Inside the method, the constraint specifications are given, similar to what you usually do in the ``Constraints()`` method. Points for each subtask can be given using ``Points()`` method, that takes a floating-point number argument as the points.

Thus, the above example can be implemented as:

.. sourcecode:: cpp

    void Subtask1() {
        Points(20);

        CONS(N == 1);
        CONS(1 <= K && K <= 100);
    }

    void Subtask2() {
        Points(20);

        CONS(1 <= N && N <= 100);
        CONS(K == 1);
    }

    void Subtask3() {
        Points(60);

        CONS(1 <= N && N <= 100);
        CONS(1 <= K && K <= 100);
    }

Test groups
-----------

If your problem has subtasks, you will be writing :ref:`test groups <test-groups>`, not test cases.
